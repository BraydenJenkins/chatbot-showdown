Players start by answering quirky questions, generating a pool of unique words and phrases. These phrases are mixed into random sets, which are randomly assigned to a player. You are then given a goal for your bot to complete, and each player must use their set of words to craft imaginative chatbot prompts to have their chatbot take on the challenge given.

In every round, the player's custom chatbots engage with a CPU character to achieve the specified goal. Your bot is embodied by an avatar that you select at the beginning of the game. The avatars in the experience have AI voices, and their animations are controlled by AI as well. Animations are dynamically chosen based on the context of a given chatbot's response, powered by Gemini Flash. After the chatbots showcase their prowess, it's voting time! Players vote for the most entertaining and clever responses, turning every game into a lively debate. Points are awarded based on votes, and the first to reach 10 points claims victory.

We attempted to rethink what a party game could be with AI at its core. Additionally, all of the prompt-building questions we ask the users and the scenarios the chatbots must go through were generated using Google Gemini.
